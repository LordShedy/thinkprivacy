<h2>Testing your browser security</h2>

<h3>Browser Fingerprint</h3>
<p>When you visit a web page, your browser voluntarily sends information about its configuration. A lot of times this information is unique, so it may be possible to identify and track you even without the use of cookies. The good folks at EFF created a Tool called Panopticlick to test your browser and see what kind of information you are giving out.</p>

<p><a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/" target="_blank" class="button special">Test Your Browser</a></p>

<h3>WebRTC IP Leak Test</h3>
<p>WebRTC is a new communication protocol that relies on JavaScript that can leak your actual IP address from behind your VPN.</p>
<p><a href="https://ipleak.net/" target="_blank" class="button">Test Your Browser</a></p>
<p><strong>How to configure Firefox to stop leaking your IP address:</strong></p>
<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
<ol>
    <li>Enter "about:config" in the firefox address bar and press enter.</li>
    <li>Press the button "I'll be careful, I promise!"</li>
    <li>Search for "media.peerconnection.enabled"</li>
    <li>Double click the entry, the column "Value" should now be "false"</li>
    <li>Done. Do the WebRTC leak test again.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Browsers such as Chrome, Chromium, or Brave, don't allow you to edit any settings to stop WebRTC leaks. You can accomplish this with some plugins, but because you have less control. RealPrivacy highly recommends using Firefox on all devices.</p>
