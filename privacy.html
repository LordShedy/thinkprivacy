							<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>
This website (realprivacy.io) does not use Google Analytics or any user tracking software. The less we know about you, the better.
</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate Links:</strong><br>
	Some links on this site are part of affiliate programs for the products recommended. This is only utilized when a product we recommend has an affiliate program and does not factor into the decision making process for adding products to the site. We do not track or store information generated by affiliate signups.</p>

	<p>Affiliate links, when available, offer us a modest way to cover basic hosting, design, or other needs to keep this site running and to also invest in testing other products.</p>

<p><strong>December 15, 2018 Update:</strong><br>
This policy update was for the remove of the text about Matomo, the Google Analytics replacement tracker. We originally used Matomo anonymously track user information. While this information can be valuable to helping promote and enhance the user experience, Matomo made some decisions around the software that made us question their devotion to user privacy. As a result, we decided to remove the software from our servers and destroy all database information along with it.</p>
